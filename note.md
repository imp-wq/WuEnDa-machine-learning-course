* Machine learning algorithms:

  * supervised learning
    * used most in real-world applications
    * rapid advancements
  * unsupervised learning

  

* practical advice for applying learning algorithms

  * input -> output

    Learns from being given "right answers".

* example: Housing price prediction - regression

### Linear Regression with One Variable

* Terminologies:

  * The training set

  * x: the input variable, is also called a feature or an input feature.

  * y: the output variable, is also called a "target" variable.

  * row: each row represents a different training example.

  * m: number of training examples

  * (x, y): single training example

  * (x superscript (i), y superscript (i)): the superscript tells us that is the i-th training example.

    i here, refers to a specific row in the table.

* process:
  1. input: the training set, includes features and targets.

  2. learning algorithm

  3. output: x->f->y-hat
